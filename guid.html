        Plan your route : <br><br>

        The first step in organizing your trip is choosing a route. Whether you want to drive along the coast of the French Riviera or want to explore the country's major cities, you'll need a rough schedule. Plan your itinerary according to the places you will spend the night and the main landmarks you want to visit, and leave the rest of the trip to impromptu activities and visits. If something catches your eye, change your plan and explore it. Sometimes the most fun adventures are the ones that are not planned.

        Rent your car : <br> <br>

        There is no doubt that renting a car is the easiest way to travel. In France, you will find many car rental companies, where you can choose your car with ease. The minimum age to rent a car is 25 years and the vehicle driver must have obtained the license more than one year ago. While residents of France are required to bring their license and ID card, visitors in the country must also show a passport when renting a car. Rental rules for foreign visitors may change, so it is advisable to check with the company what paperwork you will need.
        
        If you plan to drive in turns, make sure that the insurance contract covers multiple drivers, and if off-road driving is your hobby, we recommend renting a four-wheel drive vehicle.      </td>

        Check the condition of the car : <br> <br>

        In order to enjoy a comfortable trip, you will need a car in its best condition. If you plan to use your personal vehicle, make sure the battery, brakes, lights, and engine are in perfect condition, and don't forget to check the oil and tire pressure (including the spare tire). It is also useful to bring emergency equipment with you for the car, such as spare keys, electrical cords, and a battery charger. Having this equipment will help you solve any minor problem that may disrupt your trip.      </td>

        Ask the people of the country :<br> <br>

        There is no doubt that visitors' reviews on tourist sites are very useful for planning a trip. But if you want to discover stunning landscapes or try local delicacies in a good restaurant, there is no better way to do so than by asking the locals of the area. The French are famous for their kindness and welcoming guests, so do not hesitate to talk to them, as this could be the beginning of the most beautiful story of your trip.      </td>

        Enjoy your trip : <br> <br> 

        A road trip in a car is an adventure in itself, so take advantage of it. Stop to take the most beautiful pictures, explore the villages on your way and enjoy the mountain views. Saudi Arabia is full of regions of unique beauty that are worth visiting, and traveling on its roads will allow you to discover the Kingdom with comfort and flexibility. Show respect in the places you visit, be courteous to other drivers, do not throw rubbish out of the car and be aware of the local culture and social rules.      </td>

        <p>The less time you spend driving, the more time you have to explore new places. An early start in the morning allows you to avoid crowded streets and spend an enjoyable day visiting many sights. It will also allow you not to drive the car at night. Plan your route and stop (at a gas station, for example) whenever you cover a certain distance, or take turns driving. If you plan to drive off major routes, take precautions. Although a GPS navigation device is very useful, it may not work in remote areas or on rough roads, so it is best to download the map to the device to use it when not connected to the network, or bring a paper map with you as a backup.</p>

        <p>
          You bring less luggage with you, and you seem to have more room for souvenirs and gifts, and you won't have to lug around backpacks every night. Prepare a bag with return supplies such as antibacterial wipes, face masks, face masks, sunglasses, sunscreen, sunscreen, a waterproof thermal bag, snacks, and a portable phone charger. We also advise you to include clothing and towels so that you can enjoy swimming if you have the opportunity.  </p>    </div>

        Traveling with children requires careful planning. Preparing in advance a list of games as well as other types of entertainment activities will help you avoid boredom. In addition to music, electronic games, audiobooks and board games, there are plenty of other road trip games - such as puzzles - that the whole family can participate in. And if all of these activities don't work, their favorite snacks will keep the car calm.  </p>    </div>
