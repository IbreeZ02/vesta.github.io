    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We are a group of young people who have created a tourist website that makes it easier for tourists to travel and move around cities and have many experiences and adventures without worrying about questions, tickets, visas, and so on. The idea was when research came out from universities and institutes about peopleâ€™s fear of travel, the difficult and complicated procedures, and the lack of companionship on the trip. Hence the attempt to search for a solution, or at least an attempt to find a solution so that people can travel, enjoy, and have experiences and adventures. </p>
